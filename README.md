# Flow Up Web

Frontend application for **Flow Up** — a real-time project management and Kanban-based task tracking system.

This application demonstrates a production-oriented React architecture with scalable state management, real-time updates, role-based access control, and advanced task management capabilities.

---

## Overview

Flow Up Web is a modern single-page application built with a strongly typed React stack.
It communicates with the backend via REST and WebSocket, supports authentication with JWT (access + refresh), and implements real-time collaborative updates.

## Core Features

* Workspace management
* Kanban boards
* Tasks CRUD
* Drag & Drop (columns & tasks)
* Comments system
* File attachments
* Image cropping before upload
* Activity history tracking
* Statistics dashboard
* Role-based access control

## Architecture

The project follows a modular feature-oriented structure inspired by feature-based architecture principles.

Key architectural decisions:

* Centralized state management with **Redux Toolkit**
* API layer implemented via **RTK Query**
* Optimized caching and invalidation strategies
* Real-time synchronization using **Socket.IO**
* Strong runtime validation using **Zod**
* Domain-based feature separation
* Reusable UI components built with **shadcn/ui**
* Clean separation between UI, business logic, and API layer
